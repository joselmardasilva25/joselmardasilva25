- ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m a Data Science student with a background in Economics and a strong foundation in Statistics. Although my journey in data science is just beginning, Iâ€™m fully committed to achieving an advanced level and standing out in the field.

Iâ€™m constantly looking to learn and improve my technical skills, as well as to build a network with other professionals and data science enthusiasts. I believe in the power of collaboration and am excited about the potential contributions from the community to the projects I get involved in.

If you share these interests and would like to exchange ideas, develop collaborative projects, or simply chat about data science, feel free to reach out!
